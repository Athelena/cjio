    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the problems that I'm trying to solve with the API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *It is cumbersome to work with 3D city models in a Python script or program, partially because the data model is complex and libraries for parsing it don't really exist.* Why Python? Because in my opinion 3D city models should be similarly easy to work with as other data models/formats in the analysis pipeline. Python is one of the most common scripting languages for data analysis, which includes GIS. Also this is the language that we teach to our students at the Geomatics MSc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Luckily we have CityJSON already, which simplifies the data model part considerably. Also cjio works well in the command line. But in my experience, and according to a few other people, it would be handy to have a python library that allows to easily operate on a 3D city model. I'm heavily influenced by the *tidyverse* ecosystem in R, and also by the *pandas*, *scikit-learn* libraries in python. Thus in my head, cjio would allow to work with data as easily as these packages do, and also integrate with them.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## What has been done already?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started, cjio already had a well developed CLI. The idea is to expose the same functionality through an API, and also to provide and object-based interface to CityJSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is [citygson](https://github.com/citygml4j/citygson), a Gson based library for parsing and serializing CityJSON. This is a Java library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The API\n",
    "\n",
    "I approach the API design from the workflow that I aim at. As in **data preparation**, which entails reading a city model into python in a way that it becomes easy to work with each CityObject individually. Then **feature generation**, which is computing any measures, statistics from the CityObjects which can be fed into an analysis process.\n",

    "However this is problematic in Python, because I want to have `__init__` methods for both CityModel and Boundary. While in the case above, `Boundary.__init__()` overrides `CityModel.__init__()`, making CityModel.vertices inaccessible (AttributeError) from the Boundary instances. Setting the vertices attribute outside `CityModel.__init__()` would require to instantiate a CityModel object in two steps, and would only work if vertices is not a property and there are `get_/set_vertices()` methods, which is not really pythonic. This is all because in Python everything is public. There are no real private attributes and methods as in C++.\n"
